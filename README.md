# guests app

Allow classifying users or contacts as guests

Jails a user into a readonly home storage

* TODO If his quota is 0 TODO below x
* TODO If he is member of a configurable group
* If he is a contact of another user and has been shared a file

# FIXME

send the generated password to the user instead of logging it

# TODO

-[ ] probably prevent guests to access other apps. for now the admin should create a users group and allow only normal users to access all apps
-[ ] in admin settings allow classifying users as guests when: 1. quota is 0, 2. user is member of a certain group, 3. is a contact ?
