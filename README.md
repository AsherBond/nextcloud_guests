Guests 
=======

Create a guest user by typing their name in to the sharing dialog. The guest
will receive an email invite with a link to create an account. They only have access
to files which are shared with them.


Furthermore, the administrator has to whitelist the applications that guests can use.
By default the following are allowed:
* activity
* files_external
* files_sharing
* files_texteditor
* files_trashbin
* files_versions
* firstrunwizard
* gallery
* notifications
